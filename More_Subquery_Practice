-- Nested Subquery
-- 1. Pull month level information about the first order ever placed in the orders table.

/*
SELECT MIN(DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at))
FROM orders;
*/

-- 2. Use the result to find only the orders that took place in the same month and year as the first order, and
--    then pull the average for each type of paper qty in this month (as well as the total amount spent in usd).

SELECT ROUND(AVG(standard_qty),2) avg_std, ROUND(AVG(gloss_qty),2) avg_gls, ROUND(AVG(poster_qty),2) avg_post, SUM(total_amt_usd) total_usd
FROM orders 
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) =
	(SELECT MIN(DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at))
	FROM orders);
