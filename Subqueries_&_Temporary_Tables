-- Temporary Tables
-- What is the top channel used by each account to market products?
-- How often was that same channel used?
-- 1. Let's find the number of times each channel is used by each account.

SELECT a.name account, w.channel, COUNT(*) used
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
GROUP BY 1, 2;

-- 2. Ok, now we have how often each channel was used by each account. 
--    How do we only return the most used account (or accounts if multiple are tied for the most)?

SELECT T1.account, MAX(T1.used)
FROM 
	(SELECT a.name account, w.channel, COUNT(*) used
	FROM accounts a
	JOIN web_events w
	ON a.id = w.account_id
	GROUP BY 1, 2) T1
GROUP BY 1;

-- 3. So now we have the MAX usage number for a channel for each account.
--    Now we can use this to filter the original table to find
--    channels for each account that match the MAX amount for their account.

SELECT T1.name, T1.channel, T2.max_count
FROM (SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) AS channel_count
	  FROM accounts a
	  JOIN web_events w
	  ON a.id = w.account_id
	  GROUP BY 1, 2) T1

JOIN (SELECT T1.name, MAX(T1.channel_count) AS max_count
	  FROM (SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) AS channel_count
	  	    FROM accounts a
	  	    JOIN web_events w
	  	    ON a.id = w.account_id
	  	    GROUP BY 1, 2) T1
	  GROUP BY 1) T2
ON T1.name = T2.name AND T1.channel_count = T2.max_count
ORDER BY 1;
