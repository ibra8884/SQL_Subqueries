-- FIRST SUBQUERY (INLINE)
-- 1. Number of events that occur for each day, for each channel

/*
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS date, channel, COUNT(*) events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC; 
*/

-- 2. Create a subquery that simply provides all of the data from your first query

/*
SELECT *
FROM
(SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS date, channel, COUNT(*) events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;
*/

-- 3. Find the average number of events for each channel.

SELECT channel, ROUND(AVG(events),2) average_daily_events
FROM
    (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS date, channel, COUNT(*) events
    FROM web_events
    GROUP BY 1, 2) sub
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
